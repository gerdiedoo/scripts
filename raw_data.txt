
City of Iriga - Gerd

History
Iriga was converted into a city through the signing of R.A. 5261 otherwise known as the Charter of Iriga City on July 8, 1968 by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos. The City, however, was formally organized and inaugurated as the third city of Bicol on September 3, 1968 by Presidential Proclamation and officiated by the President of the Philippines.
Since then, Iriga City has developed tremendously making it not only as a center of trade and commerce in the Rinconada area but the whole Bicol Region as well, if not the entire Southern Luzon, as it is strategically located between the cities of Naga and Legaspi.
The City of Iriga had a population of 97,983 in 2007 (2007 NSO Survey) and an average growth rate of 1.46 percent per annum. This population is distributed in 19,957 households or an average household size of 5.1 in 36 barangays. This is projected to increase to 106,886 population & 20,958 households. A 4th class city, it has an annual income of P321,196,898.00 in 2010.
In the May 10, 2004 elections, Hon. Madelaine Y. Alfelor-Gazmen, the first lady mayor of Iriga City was elected with Jose SG. Villlanueva, Jr. as her Vice-Mayor, and assumed office on July 1, 2004.

Buhi - Gerd
History
The town known today as Buhi began as a small settlement by refugees fleeing the outrage of Mayon Volcano hundreds of years ago. These people founded a permanent settlement in an area close to the lake and flourished as time passed.
The general exodus of people fleeing and being able to escape grave calamities such as Mayon's eruption was known in local vernacular as "naka-buhi". Local lore takes this as the most probable explanation as to how the town acquired its present name – Buhi. One version of local legend attributes the town being accorded the name to the time when the first Spaniards came and asked local settlers the name of the area. The local settlers misunderstood the question as how they came to be there and so gave the response "Naka-Buhi".
There were two patron saints with whom the town directed their devotion. The first was St. Francis of Assisi placed in the church made of wooden materials. Unfortunately, in 1730 the church was razed down by fire. It was, however, replaced by a stone structure built under the supervision of Rev. Fray Jose de Cerda. Another saint was installed, St. Anthony of Padua.

Trivia about the city
Libmanan
Libmanan
History
Libmanan was a barrio of Quipayo in 1580 with the name of "Pinaglabanan". Records from a historian Mauro B. Avila, revealed that the municipality was named Libmanan on September 15, 1574. Missionaries started working in Libmanan in 1589 and the area's church was dedicated to St. James the Apostle.
German ethnographer Fedor Jagor described visiting Libmanan in his 1875 work "Travels in the Philippines", wherein he visited the local parish priest and learned from him about an ancient human settlement that had been dug up in 1851 during road construction in the Poro area of the southwest close near the Tres Marias islands: the excavation consisted of "numerous remains of the early inhabitants—skulls, ribs, bones of men and animals, a child’s thigh bone inserted in a spiral of brass wire, several stags’ horns, beautifully-formed dishes and vessels, some of them painted, probably of Chinese origin; striped bracelets, of a soft, gypseous, copper-red rock, gleaming as if they were varnished; small copper knives, but no iron utensils; and several broad flat stones bored through the middle; besides a wedge of petrified wood, embedded in a cleft branch of a tree."
During the occupation of their country by the United States, the Philippine Legislature greatly expanded the network of railroads throughout the island of Luzon, and a railway headed to the city of Legazpi, Albay and Naga, Camarines Sur was built through Libmanan to provide direct access to those cities.[6] This railway was damaged severely during World War II, but partially restored using American funds thereafter, providing transportation service down the Bicol Peninsula off and on until ending in 2012 despite plans to rehabilitate the route.
The historic Morales Ruins Art Deco mansion at the heart of the town was built in 1937 by the Rev. Friar Mariano Roldan for his parents, and was eventually sold to the Morales family whose name the ruins now bear. It is noted for art deco frescos which are emblematic of the period in which it was built, one of which includes a defiantly displayed Filipino national flag, which would have been disallowed by the American and Japanese occupiers of the time.
Even during the time of the Spaniards, the town of Libmanan was already considered the "rice basket" of the province.This generous production of rice is attributed to the fertile soil and the town's abundant water supply. In 1991 the area's irrigation canals (shared with its northern neighbor Cabusao, Camarines Sur) were sufficient to water 2996 hectares of land during the dry season.
Barangay Poblacion is often referred to by locals as "Libmanan" while the surrounding urban Barangays are referred to as "Metropolitan Libmanan" or "Greater Poblacion Area" unofficially.

Trivia about the city
Known For
Libmanan River
The Libmanan river had played a significant role in the emergence of ancient Bicol civilization. It has shaped the history and cultural heritage of the Libmanan. It was once considered as the prime mode of transportation in going in and out of the municipality for trade, work and educational activities. 
https://kynaswhereabouts.tumblr.com/post/132760846698/handiong-expedition-a-cruise-on-the-river-where#:~:text=The%20Libmanan%20river%20had%20played,trade%2C%20work%20and%20educational%20activities.
DILANCO’S TAMBOBONG OR GRANARY
As a rice producer and rice trader of the town (including nearby towns Cabusao, Canaman and Magarao) they made the house not only the oldest Tambobong or rice granary of the family but the oldest comprada of the town buying the local produced rice, copra and corn of the farmers of Libmanan which the reason why the house became known as the warehouse of the NARIC (National Rice and Corn Administration) and later called to many names as Rice Corn Authority and National Grains Authority (also National Food Authority or NFA).
In a patriotic gesture of the family during World War 2, the Tambobong became the silent witness of their generosity and deep concern for the guerilla movement known as the Tancong Vaca Guerilla Unit or TVGU that was founded by the town’s residents of Libmanan when they intentionally opened the Tambobong to help and support the guerrillas fighting for the freedom from the hands of the Japanese invaders. It was said that during the night towards the end of April in 1942, the Dilanco family had freely given the almost 30,000 bags of rice hoarded by Japanese inside this Tambobong of the Dilancos to the fighting guerillas and to the people of Libmanan in a scripted manner where the TVGU’s men and the Dilancos where the main actors to fool the Japanese. 
Thus, this Dilanco’sTambobong of the town can be counted as one of the cultural and historical sites of Libmanan since this edifice further affirms that Libmanan is truly the ancient Tambobong of Kabikolan or the Rice Granary of Bicol and this house symbolizes the patriotism or the love of the country of the people of Libmanan. Therefore, it is worthy of preservation and appreciation from the people of Libmanan.

GEOGRAPHY
Libmanan is a large municipality, one of the biggest in Camarines Sur. It stretched across nearly the whole width of the Bicol peninsula, from where it borders Cabusao Municipality on the San Miguel Bay all the way out to the Ragay Gulf, including three islands known locally as the 'tres Marias', including one island known as 'puro island'. The main town, or 'poblacion', is located along the Libmanan River on the lowland alluvial plain adjacent to Cabusao.
Heading to the southern coast from the poblacion the municipality becomes hilly. In this hilly region between the poblacion and the highway lies the Libmanan Caves National Park. Continuing on towards the coast from the hills, the municipality becomes truly mountainous beginning in Barangay Malinao beyond the Pan-Philippine Highway, where the "Boro-Boro Spring Resort" is located; a series of waterfalls that are a locally popular swimming destination.[10] Beyond Malinao the upland region features the mountain 'Mount Bernacci (Tancong Vaca' - in the local dialect meaning 'the cow's hump') - which is a local landmark visible from most locations on the Pan-Philippine Highway in western Camarines Sur and was a base of operations for local guerrillas fighting the Japanese during World War II. Up to the present day, the area around Tancong Vaca has remained an area of conflict between anti-government insurgents and the Philippine National Police.
The municipality's rural barangays lie behind Mount Bernacci, and mostly lack access to paved roads, of which there is only one which terminates in the fishing village of Barangay Bahao, within sight of the tres Marias.
		HERITAGE
The town possesses one of the most important cultural examples of ancestral houses in western Camarines Sur. Among these architectural marvels are the 1920s municipal hall building with its arcade-embellished facade, the 1875 Dilanco House which is the oldest structure in the town and was home to three former municipal mayors, the 1937 Morales Ruins which is the most culturally-important Art Deco building in the town, the Nacieno House which is another Art Deco ancestral house, and the 1926 Jaucian House Jose Jaucian Sr. Another ancestral house that was demolished in the late 1970s is the house built by Don Celedonio Reyes, it was demolished to make way for more modern buildings of the Bicol Central Academy.

Most heritage houses in the town have already been abandoned, including the Morales Ruins, Nacieno House, and the Dilanco House. In 2013, a campaign was administered by some locals to transform the Morales Ruins into a municipal museum, along with other heritage houses in the town to spur a heritage-based tourism industry and to conserve the remaining immovable cultural heritage of the town.

Lagonoy
History
There are two version as how Lagonoy got its name. Year 1734 when the first Spaniards in this place found a small forested area near a creek where "hagonoy", a medicinal plant grew abundantly. Because the Spaniards could hardly pronounce the word "hagonoy" with the "j" sound, with "ha" of the first syllable, they deliberately decided to change "ha" to "la". Since then, the place was known as "Lagonoy". Some of the residents also believed that the name was taken from the word "lango" meaning drunk. During fiestas and other forms or merry making, men used to drink too much "tuba" (native wine) that they become drunk or "lango" (Bikol for drunk) so that the place was called by the neighboring towns as "Lagonoy".

In 1569, the Franciscan Spanish missionaries reached the Bicol Region including the provinces of Masbate, Ticao, Burias, and Albay. Further in their exploration, they found a small settlement along a river bordered by a string of hills and mountains to the North. To its West lies a tall and solitary mountain (Mt. Isarog); to its South--a sprawling stretch of plains and to its East--the sea.

​The Spaniards noticed a type of herb that grows abundantly around the area which the natives call "HAGONOY' (Chromolaena Odorata Linn or Devil Weed). Its small flowers have tiny mauve and white petals used by the locals as a medicinal plant. Because of this, the missionaries named the area "La Hagonoy" and over time, the "Ha" was dropped leading to its present name "Lagonoy".
The town became a full-pledged parish in 1764 under the ecclesiastical province of Nueva Caceres and its first stone church was erected in 1768. However, due to its location near the Lagonoy river, it was destroyed by a flood and now only serves as a living memory of the past.

Trivia about the city

Caramoan
Caramoan is a 2nd class coastal municipality in camarines sur province of Bicol Region, Philippines. It is one of the most visited places in the region because of the natural beauty of its islands, beaches, coves, and mountains.
History
Former names of the town of Caramoan are Gota de Leche and Carahan. In 1619, the Spaniards, led by Father Francisco de la Cruz Y Oropesa, explored the area and founded a small settlement called Baluarte.
The name Caramoan has been officially used since 1619, the year it was named by a Spanish missionary friar, Francisco de la Cruz Y Oropesa. Fr. Oropesa penetrated the thick virgin forest of the Caramoan Peninsula and founded a small settlement in a place called Baluarte. This settlement was subsequently turned over to the administration of the Holy Bishopric in 1696.

Isla Carahan Festival -	A celebration of the beauty and bountry of Caramoan Island, highlighting its industrv and cultural heritage. 
Festival Duration: April 30 - May 8


Trivia about the city
The remoteness of Caramoan and the distinct castaway island feel is perhaps why the makers of the popular reality TV show and most of its foreign franchises repeatedly choose Caramoan as their chosen destination to shoot the TV show Survivor.
The unexploited and uninhabited islands of Caramoan have been featured in several franchises and repeatedly choose as a chosen destination to shoot by the Survivor TV show.


Caramoan also has its own story. According to the locals, there were two Bangus living in the lagoon(located at matukad island), however, there was a person who caught one of them and he died. After the story circulated in the area, no one ever touched the remaining bangus in the said lagoon.

Gainza
History
Gainza is not a young municipality neither it can be counted among our ancient towns and cities. However, its origin is as old as “Ciudad de Caceres” – Naga City today. The Municipality of Gainza was formerly a barrio of Ciudad de Cacares founded by Captain Pedro de Chavez.

The barrio of Ciudad de Caceres was called Sto. Domingo, after its patron saint, Sto. Domingo de Guzman. Because the natives of this farming and fishing village had progressively clung to the fertile lowland soil and fish- rich meandering rivers and creeks in the central part of the province, its people earned the benevolence and recognition of Bishop Francisco Gainza, O.P. of Nueva Caceres. On December 10, 1863, His Excellency, the Bishop, gave the village of Sto. Domingo its Ecclesiastical Charter as a municipality. The feast of the parish patron saint, St. Dominic of Guzman is celebrated annually on August 8.

For many noble and lofty reasons, it was named after the late bishop of Nueva Caceres, the Most. Rev. Francisco Gainza of the Dominican Order. Historical records tell us further that the Bishop was a brilliant Patron of education, a builder and a fearless planner.

Trivia about the city
Rev. Francisco Gainza selected the barrio Sto. Domingo(Gainza) for the construction of a canal or passageway originally planned by two Franciscan Friars and by Governor Norzagaray as early as the first half of the 17th Century. The canal was to serve two purposes: one to connect the river of Naga to the sea of Pasacao which would shorten the route from Naga to Manila avoiding the treacherous San Bernardino Strait, and the other is to serve as another outlet for the flood waters of the lower plains of the province.

If the Bicol River Basin Development Program pushed through the building of the canal, the flooding of towns along the Bikol river could have been avoided. Gainza would have become a progressive community nowadays.

Gainza, Camarines Sur was featured in a popular TV show named “Byahe ni Drew”

San Jose
History
The town of San Jose, then known as Danlog, was a barrio of Lagonoy in the early 19th century. It remained part of Lagonoy until the year 1813 when San Jose was established under the name of Patrocinio derived from the word "patron" which means "model". Later, the words "de San Jose" were attached to its former name, thus becoming Patrocinio de San Jose. But it was soon shortened to San Jose which is now the official name of the municipality.
May 19 marks the annual celebration of the feast day of San Jose, the town's patron saint.

Trivia about the city



Ocampo - jm
History : The municipality of Ocampo traced its existence as the former “Mission de Mabatobato” launched by the Franciscan friars in 1735. The place was named “Mabatobato” because of the presence of huge rocks scattered all over the place believed to have erupted from Mt. Isarog. As a mission, it has four barrios; Ayugan, Tinablanan, Pinit and Moriones.

In the early 1800s, people from neighboring towns began to flock the area to settle and till the vast areas of lands suited for agriculture. The place began to flourish that the people began to dream of transforming the settlement into a new municipality. Cabeza de Barangay Michael Alcantara and Don Jose Barangbang requested and pleaded to the Bishop of Caceres to make the barrio into a town. The request was granted.

In 1917, Mabatobato was annexed to the municipality of Pili to help it recover from the Spanish–American War and for effective governance. By 1922 it was made into a new parish. Baptisms and burials were first recorded that year. The place began to flourish again and influx of immigrants from neighboring towns as well as from Batangas and Tayabas were observed.

After three decades, the leaders and the people of Mabatobato began to clamor for independence and to govern themselves once again. In 1948, during the incumbency of Congressman Sebastian C. Moll, Jr., 2nd District Camarines Sur, the dream to separate had been brewed. President Elpidio Quirino signed Executive Order No. 243 dated 15 July 1949 entitled: “Organizing Certain Barrios of the Municipality of Pili, Camarines Sur, into an Independent Municipality under the name of OCAMPO”.

Mabatobato was renamed in honor of Don Julian Ocampo who was the Governor of Camarines Sur in the 1930s. Upon the appointment and qualification of the first municipal officials, Ocampo has begun to officially exist as an independent municipality on August 10, 1949.

Trivia about the city

Pamplona - JM 
History 
The beginnings of this town can be traced back from the date it was made a visita of Milaor. The town of Pamplona was founded in 1817. It first started as a settlement in Western area of the Bicol River, then it grew to become a Sitio called Patong. The name was changed to Pamplona by a retired Spanish military officer who resided in the place and named it after his native city in Spain - Pamplona, capital of Basque, Province of Navarro.

Historical references concluded that most Spaniards inhabiting the place came from the province of Pamplona in Spain and thus decided to name their settlement also as "Pamplona".

Pamplona officially became a parish on May 8, 1885, which coincided with the date of the town's celebration honoring their patron saint, St. Michael Archangel.

Baao - Art
History
Little is known about the exact history and origin of the name Baao. Except for the fragment of history that were complied from sporadic sources combined with the tales and legends cul­tured by transfer of tongues from generation-to-generation.
Tradition says that the town earned its name from the word ba-o-o, a local term for the native fresh-water turtle, which grew excessively in abundance in the vicinity of the ancient settlement site of Binabaloy, Binanuaanan and Layoan, where the Spaniards found the early Baao folks, and which place then formed a part of the adjacent town of Bula. It is said that for purposes of geographic references, the Spaniards designated the place as Baao, a close resemblance to the word ba-o-o, which was probably difficult for a foreign tongue to pronounce.
Another theory relates its significance to the topography of the early site of the poblacion which was the turtle-shaped sitio Binanuaanan. This southern bank of the lake Baao, when viewed at a vantage point in the mountain ranges, reveals a concave shape. With its arable fields cris-crossed with dikes and ditches, it closely resembles the back of the turtle.
Still another theory takes into account a remote possibil­ity that the name Baao evolved from the manifest disposition of eating left-over rice from previous meal. The natives at that time and even now relish from what they call ba-wow which means not hot in the local dialect.
What really is the basis of its name remains in doubt and mystery. Credence is attributed mainly in the legends and tales that made Baao known to the present day.

Balatan - Art
History
Balatan is not an old municipality like the other towns in the fourth district. It was once a sitio known as Siramag which belonged to the town of Nabua.
In 1951, Camarines Sur Provincial Board Member Gregorio O. Balatan Sr. proposed a resolution to divide Nabua into two municipalities: Nabua and Balatan. Balatan then was separated from its mother town and became independent on December 3, 1951, under Executive Order (EO) No. 485 of then President Elpidio Quirino. It was named after Don Rufino Balatan which is the father of Board Member Gregorio O. Balatan Sr.
Seven years after its establishment as a town, the Parish of Our Mother of Perpetual Help was erected by Archbishop Pedro P. Santos. Balatan observes the annual Pintakasi fiesta celebration every February 16–18.

Bombon - Art
History
Like any other municipalities in the province, the town of Bombon also started as a mere barrio or "visita". It was dependent on the town of the ancient Quipayo for nearly 240 years, now a mere barangay of Calabanga town. It finally gained its independence during the arrival of the Americans on February 11, 1900. This taste of freedom was, however, momentary for after the establishment of the Civil Government occurred in the Philippines in the year 1903, Bombon was ceded to the municipality of Calabanga .
The municipality of Bombon also became a barrio of Magarao, now another town in the second district. For more than forty years of waiting, it was finally given its proclamation as a town by virtue of Executive Order (EO) 251 dated July 27, 1949 signed by the then President Elpidio Quirino. Appointed officials are Jose Buenagua Sr, Mayor; Juan Nale, Casiano Aburro, Manuel Rojo, and Julian Sumangid, Councilors. Jose Buenagua Jr went on to be the Provincial Engineer of Albay. Jose Jr now resides in Scottsdale AZ. He had also two daughters, Irene Buenagua Fernandez and Lydia Buenagua Guerrero, both retired teachers, and three other sons, Salvador, Melchor, and Diogenes Buenagua who are all still residing in Bombon. The acquired independence continued permanently and it served well its constituents. Foundation Anniversary celebrated every August 13.
In 1993, by EO no. 102 of President Fidel V. Ramos, Bombon was included in the creation of the Metro Naga Development Council together with Bula, Calabanga, Camaligan, Canaman, Gainza, Magarao, Milaor, Minalabac, Ocampo, Pamplona, Pasacao, Pili, and San Fernando, all in the province of Camarines Sur.
"Bombon" was once an old name of Taal Lake in Batangas illustrated in a 1885 antique map. Batangas was first came to be known as Bombon also.
The Leaning Bell Tower, dubbed as the country's own version of Italy 's Leaning Tower of Pisa, found in this municipality serves as a major historical attraction.

Bula - Art
History
The town of Bula is historically considered as one of the first four mission towns of Camarines Sur founded by the Spanish conquistadores when they set foot on the Bicol soil coming from the Visayas in 1576. The other premier towns were Naga, Quipayo and Nabua.
The Spaniards who first came to this place asked the men who were splitting bamboos about the name of the place, and since they did not understand the language, they thought that they were being asked about the name of the bamboo, and so they got the answer "Bu-la". And so Bula became the name of the town.
However, it was only in 1578 when the natives where Christianized, so the National Historical Commission dates back the town's history to 1578. From this, the town chose St. Mary Magdalene as its patron saint and celebrates its fiesta every 22nd day of July, which is the birthdate of the saint.
